# MEDICAL COSTS PREDICTION WITH ML ALGORITHMS

An insurance policy reduces or eliminates the costs of losses brought on by various risks. The price of
insurance is impacted by numerous factors. These factors play a role in how insurance policies are
created. The wording of insurance policies can be more effectively written with the use of machine
learning (ML) in the insurance industry sector. **This study shows how several regression models can
predict insurance costs.**

Two key questions that are relevant to the Insurance industry sector:

This study shows how several regression models can predict insurance costs. Therefore,
1. Which ML algorithm model could predict medical costs better?
2. What are the significant factors that affect predicting medical costs?

By knowing the factors that affect medical costs of an individual, policy makers can formulate better
insurance plans for society. Moreover, the factors that influence medical costs could possibly be the
factors causing illness and medical bills. Therefore, Knowing the common factors that influence patientsâ€™
health can be beneficial to the health care sector.
